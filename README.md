# Automotive Business Solutions Integration Challenge

## Setup

1. If you haven't already, sign up for GitHub and [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new) called `integration-challenge` and set it to Private.
3. Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/abs-warranty/integration-challange.git`
4. `cd` into the cloned integration-challenge repo and add your private repository as a remote, so you can push to it. `git remote add upstream git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/integration-challenge.git`
5. Create a new branch off of the `integration-challenge` repo where you can make your code changes and open a PR to the `master` branch once you're done. `get checkout -b challenge`
6. After you have finished coding the challenge, when you're ready to push your code to your branch, make sure to do `git push upstream challenge`.

Make sure yuo have Node.js and `yarn` installed globally, then start the repo:

```(terminal)
yarn install
yarn start
```

You should now have the app running on `http://localhost:8083`.

**Before submitting your code, please make sure to lint and format it.**
